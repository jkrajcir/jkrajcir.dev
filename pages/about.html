        My name is Joe Krajcir and I am a software engineer that likes a good
        challenge and solving tough problems! I love learning about new
        technological tools to build effective software solutions.

        cloud services. I applied the new skills and tools that I learned by
        building the web application

        When away from the keyboard, I like to go running, watching movies and
        TV series, go for walks, and occasionally go work on my golf game.
